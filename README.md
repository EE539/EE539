Hello 👋

I'm from Turkey and I'm a newly graduated Computer Engineer. 

I have knowledge in C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PhP, Oracle SQL, MySQL, SQLite3, HTML, and CSS. My favourite language so far is C#. I think I like anything as long as I'm coding.

Do not hesitate to contact me for any collaboration or freelance work.

Best regards
